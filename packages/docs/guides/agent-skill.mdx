description: Teach AI agents to compose motion graphics with oanim
---

The `animate-skill/` directory contains an agent skill that teaches AI agents how to compose professional motion graphics using Remotion + `@oanim/core`.

## What is an agent skill?

An agent skill is a structured set of references, templates, and workflow instructions that an AI coding agent (like Claude) can use to produce high-quality output in a specific domain. The oanim skill teaches agents the oanim workflow, animation presets, composition patterns, and best practices.

## Prerequisites

The oanim skill builds on top of **Remotion skills** for core Remotion API knowledge:

```bash
npx skills add remotion-dev/skills
```

oanim adds premium animation presets, components, and a workflow CLI on top of Remotion's foundations.

```

## Agent workflow

The skill instructs agents to follow this workflow:

1. **Initialize** — `oanim init my-video`
2. **Compose** — Write scenes using `@oanim/core` presets and components
3. **Preview** — `npx remotion studio`
4. **Render** — `oanim render`
5. **Assets** (optional) — `oanim assets gen-image`

## When to use what

| Need | Tool |
|---|---|
| Core Remotion API (`interpolate`, `spring`, `Sequence`) | Remotion skills |
| Animation presets (`fadeUp`, `popIn`, springs) | `@oanim/core` |
| Ready-made components (`Terminal`, `Card`, `Badge`) | `@oanim/core` |
| Scene transitions (`fadeBlur`, `clipCircle`) | `@oanim/core` + `@remotion/transitions` |
| Project scaffolding | `oanim init` |
| Rendering to video | `oanim render` |
| AI asset generation | `oanim assets` |

## Templates

Templates provide full scene-by-scene blueprints for common video types:

| Template | Description |
|---|---|
| `launch-video` | 4-scene product launch with hero, features, demo, CTA |
| `explainer` | Step-based explainer with numbered sections |
| `logo-reveal` | Logo animation with glow effects |
| `meme-caption` | Quick vertical social clip |
| `investor-update` | Metrics dashboard with CountUp numbers |

Each template includes complete code for every scene, recommended transitions, and duration guidelines.
