title: Cloud Rendering
description: Render videos in the cloud without local infrastructure
---

Cloud rendering lets you export videos without needing Chromium or ffmpeg installed locally. Your project is bundled, uploaded, and rendered on hosted infrastructure using Remotion Lambda.

## Usage

```bash
oanim render --cloud
```

<Note>
Cloud rendering requires authentication. Run `oanim login` first, or set `ANIMATE_API_KEY`.
</Note>

## How it works

<Steps>

### Bundle

Remotion bundles your project locally (`remotion bundle`), creating a static site with your compositions.

### Upload

The bundle tarball is uploaded to the platform via `/api/v1/render/upload`.

### Render

The platform renders your composition on AWS Lambda using Remotion's distributed rendering. Your `animate.json` settings (resolution, codec, fps, props) are applied.

### Stream progress

The CLI polls for progress updates every 2 seconds and displays a percentage.

### Download

The rendered MP4 is downloaded to your output path via a presigned S3 URL.

</Steps>

## Options

All standard `oanim render` flags work with `--cloud`:

```bash
oanim render --cloud --out out/video.mp4
oanim render --cloud --fps 60 --res 3840x2160
oanim render --cloud --codec h265
```

See [oanim render](/cli/render) for the full flag reference.

## Output

On success:

```
✔ Cloud render complete

Output:     /path/to/out/MyComp.mp4
Size:       2.4 MB
Resolution: 1920x1080
FPS:        30
Codec:      h264
```

## When to use cloud rendering

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Local development | Use local `oanim render` for fast iteration |
| CI/CD pipelines | Use `--cloud` to avoid installing Chromium in CI |
| Machines without ffmpeg | Use `--cloud` |
| Long/complex compositions | Use `--cloud` for better hardware |
| Quick previews | Use local render |

## Pricing

Cloud rendering is billed based on render duration and resolution. Check your current balance with `oanim usage` and purchase credits with `oanim billing buy`. See [Credits & Billing](/platform/credits-and-billing) for details.
