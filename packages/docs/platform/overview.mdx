description: Hosted services for Open Animate — media gateway, cloud rendering, and more
---

Open Animate is an **open-core platform** — everything is open source (Apache 2.0), and you can self-host it all for free. The hosted platform at `api.oanim.dev` provides managed infrastructure so you don't have to.

## Platform services

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Media Gateway" icon="images">
    Multi-provider AI image generation. Currently backed by fal.ai with Runway and other providers planned. Handles routing, cost metering, and usage tracking.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cloud Rendering" icon="cloud">
    `oanim render --cloud` sends your composition to hosted infrastructure (Remotion Lambda) and streams back the rendered MP4. No local Chromium or ffmpeg needed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Authentication" icon="lock">
    Browser-based OAuth via `oanim login`. API keys (prefixed `anim_`) for CI/CD and programmatic access.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Usage & Billing" icon="chart-bar">
    Pay-as-you-go credits with per-operation cost tracking. New accounts start with $5.00 in credits. Purchase more via Stripe with a 10% bonus on purchases over $50.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How it connects

```
oanim CLI → api.oanim.dev → fal.ai (media generation)
                           → S3 + Remotion Lambda (cloud rendering)
                           → PostgreSQL (usage tracking)
                           → Stripe (billing)
```

## Authentication chain

Credentials resolve in this order:

1. `ANIMATE_API_KEY` environment variable
2. `~/.oanim/credentials.yaml` (saved by `oanim login`)
3. Direct provider key (`ANIMATE_FAL_KEY`) — bypasses platform, goes direct to fal.ai

## Rate limits

| Endpoint | Limit |
|---|---|
| Media gateway (`/api/v1/media/*`) | 60 requests/minute per user |
| Auth endpoints (`/api/v1/auth/cli/*`) | 10 requests/minute per IP |
