description: Create and manage API keys for programmatic access
---

API keys provide programmatic access to the oanim platform — use them in CI/CD pipelines, automated workflows, or any environment where browser login isn't practical.

## Create a key

```bash
oanim api-keys create --name "ci-pipeline"
```

Output:

```
Name:   ci-pipeline
Prefix: oan_abc1...
Key:    oan_abc123def456...

⚠ Save this key — it will not be shown again.
```

<Warning>
The full key is only shown once at creation time. Store it securely.
</Warning>

## List your keys

```bash
oanim api-keys list
```

Shows all your keys with name, prefix, creation date, and last-used date.

## Revoke a key

```bash
oanim api-keys revoke <key-id>
```

Immediately invalidates the key. Any requests using it will fail.

## Using API keys

### Environment variable (recommended)

```bash
export ANIMATE_API_KEY=oan_abc123def456...
oanim assets gen-image --prompt "gradient" --out bg.png
```

### CI/CD login

```bash
oanim login --token $ANIMATE_API_KEY
```

This saves the key to `~/.oanim/credentials.yaml` so subsequent commands use it automatically.

### Resolution order

When making API calls, the CLI resolves credentials in this order:

1. `ANIMATE_API_KEY` environment variable
2. `~/.oanim/credentials.yaml` (saved by `oanim login`)

Set the env var in your CI secrets to avoid needing `oanim login` in pipelines.
