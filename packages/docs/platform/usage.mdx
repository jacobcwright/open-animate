## How usage is tracked

Usage is tracked per-operation and reported to the platform in real time. Each media gateway call (image generation, editing, background removal, upscaling) records:

- **Provider** — `fal.ai` (or `oanim` for platform-routed requests)
- **Model** — The specific AI model used
- **Operation** — `generateImage`, `editImage`, `removeBackground`, `upscale`, or `run`
- **Cost** — Estimated cost based on the model pricing table

Credits are deducted from your balance as operations complete.

## Low balance

When your balance drops below $1, you'll see a warning on every `usage` and `billing` command:

```
  ⚠ Low balance — run oanim billing buy to add credits
```

Purchase more credits with:

```bash
oanim billing buy --amount 10
```

See [Credits & Billing](/platform/credits-and-billing) for pricing details.
