title: Credits & Billing
description: Pay-as-you-go credits for platform services
---

The oanim platform uses a prepaid credit system. Purchase credits via Stripe and they're deducted per-operation as you use asset generation and cloud rendering.

## Check your balance

```bash
oanim billing
```

Shows your current credit balance and recent purchase history.

## Purchase credits

```bash
oanim billing buy --amount 25
```

| Detail | Value |
|---|---|
| Minimum purchase | $5 |
| Bonus threshold | $50+ |
| Bonus amount | 10% extra credits |

**Example:** A $100 purchase gets you $110 in credits.

The command opens a Stripe checkout page in your browser. After payment completes, credits are added to your account immediately.

## Direct provider key

If you prefer to skip the platform billing system, set `ANIMATE_FAL_KEY` with your own fal.ai API key. Requests go directly to fal.ai and are billed by them:

```bash
export ANIMATE_FAL_KEY=your-fal-key
oanim assets gen-image --prompt "gradient" --out bg.png
```

This bypasses oanim credit checks entirely.
