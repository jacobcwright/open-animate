title: Credits & Billing
description: Pay-as-you-go credits for platform services
---

The Open Animate platform uses a prepaid credit system. Purchase credits via Stripe and they're deducted per-operation as you use asset generation and cloud rendering.

## Check your balance

```bash
oanim billing
```

Shows your current credit balance and recent purchase history.

<Note>
New accounts receive **$5.00 in free credits** on signup. No credit card required to get started.
</Note>

## Purchase credits

```bash
oanim billing buy --amount 25
```

| Detail | Value |
|---|---|
| Minimum purchase | $5 |
| Bonus threshold | $50+ |
| Bonus amount | 10% extra credits |

**Example:** A $100 purchase gets you $110 in credits.

The command opens a Stripe checkout page in your browser. After payment completes, credits are added to your account immediately.

## What happens when credits run out

When your balance reaches $0, asset generation and cloud render requests will fail with an insufficient credits error. Local operations (`oanim init`, `oanim render` without `--cloud`) are always free and unaffected.

To continue using platform services, either:
- Purchase more credits: `oanim billing buy --amount 10`
- Use a direct provider key: `export ANIMATE_FAL_KEY=your-key`

## Asset generation costs

| `fal-ai/topaz/upscale/image` | $0.08 |

### Video generation

| Model | Cost |
|---|---|
| `fal-ai/minimax/hailuo-02/standard/text-to-video` | $0.27 |
| `fal-ai/kling-video/v2.5-turbo/pro/text-to-video` | $0.35 |

### Audio / speech

| Model | Cost |
|---|---|
| `beatoven/music-generation` | $0.05 |
| `beatoven/sound-effect-generation` | $0.05 |
| `minimax/speech-02-hd` | $0.05 |

### Other

| Model | Cost |
|---|---|
| `fal-ai/flux/dev/controlnet` | $0.03 |
| `fal-ai/flux/dev/ip-adapter` | $0.03 |
| `fal-ai/lora` | $0.02 |
| Unknown models | $0.05 (default) |

## Cost controls

Set a per-session cost limit to prevent runaway spending:

```bash
export ANIMATE_MAX_USD_PER_RUN=5.00
```

The CLI will refuse any operation that would push the session total over this limit.

## Direct provider key

If you prefer to skip the platform billing system, set `ANIMATE_FAL_KEY` with your own fal.ai API key. Requests go directly to fal.ai and are billed by them:

```bash
export ANIMATE_FAL_KEY=your-fal-key
oanim assets gen-image --prompt "gradient" --out bg.png
```

This bypasses Open Animate credit checks entirely.
