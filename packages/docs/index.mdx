# Open Animate

**Open-source CLI + component library for creating premium motion graphics with [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev/).**

Go from idea to rendered video in minutes — not hours. Open Animate gives you production-ready animation presets, transitions, and UI components, plus a CLI that streamlines the workflow.

<Note>
**Naming:** The project is called **Open Animate**. The npm packages are `oanim` (CLI) and `@oanim/core` (library). The GitHub repo is [jacobcwright/open-animate](https://github.com/jacobcwright/open-animate).

## Platform

Open Animate is also an **open-core platform** — everything is open source and self-hostable, with an optional hosted service at `api.oanim.dev` for cloud rendering, AI asset generation, and usage tracking. See the [Platform tab](/platform/overview) for details.

## Architecture

```
open-animate/
├── packages/
│   ├── core/       @oanim/core — animation presets + components
│   └── cli/        oanim CLI (init, render, assets)
├── animate-skill/  Agent skill (SKILL.md + references + templates)
└── examples/       6 working Remotion projects
```

### How it works

```
oanim init → scaffold Remotion project with @oanim/core
          → compose scenes using presets + components
          → npx remotion studio (preview)
          → oanim render (export MP4)
          → oanim assets (AI image generation)
```
